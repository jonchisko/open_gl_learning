A repository for learning OpenGL with Rust

The first "Hello Triangle" chapter has exercise 2 and exercise 3 in their own branches.
From the "Hello Triangle" ownards, startin with "Shaders", each chapter will be its own branch, which will then be merged into main.

The exercises for each chapter will be a branch of the chapter branch with different solutions being different commits.

### Example
- branch - "Shaders"
  - branch of branch "Shaders" -> "Shaders_exercise":
    - commit 1: Solution 1
    - commit 2: Solution 2
